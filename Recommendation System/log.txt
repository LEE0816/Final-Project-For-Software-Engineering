Amazing recommendation system!  Simple and convenient to find related class, demos and tutorials for specific research field.  It is common that many related class will be distributed in different department which is difficult to search, this systems help us a lot to find classes quickly. It will be better if we can have more detailed information about the class. Also, maybe you can try to offer your recommendations about class arrangement in one specific field, such as if I want to study in the field of machine learning, in what order should I take the classes you recommended.
